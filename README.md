# QuantumUnit

## 1. Overview

`QuantumUnit` is a Python library designed to provide a robust set of assertions and utilities for testing quantum algorithms. Drawing inspiration from popular unit testing libraries such as JUnit and xUnit, it seamlessly integrates with the quantum computing environment provided by Qiskit.

Unit tests are an essential tool in any software development project, and quantum algorithms are no exception. `QuantumUnit` allows quantum algorithm developers to apply best software development practices, including writing robust unit tests for their algorithms. Beyond supporting traditional unit tests, `QuantumUnit` is designed to facilitate property-based testing. This testing methodology, which can be particularly effective in the context of quantum computing, verifies that expected system properties or behaviours hold across a range of inputs and conditions.

By enabling comparison of quantum states and measurement outcomes, `QuantumUnit` offers a testing framework that accommodates the uniqueness of the quantum environment, where algorithm outcomes are not always deterministic.

This library provides a variety of assertion methods that can be used to verify the status of a quantum circuit after its execution. It offers methods to check for equality with a given vector state, verify the presence of entanglement between specific qubits, check for general entanglement among a set of qubits, and conduct equality, inequality, less than, greater than, and in-between comparisons in the context of classical states.

`QuantumUnit` is easy to use and integrate into any project that utilizes Qiskit, and can be a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit working with quantum computing.

## 2. Installation

To install QuantumUnit, you can use pip:

```
pip install quantumunit
```

## 3. Usage

```python
from QuantumUnit import QuantumUnit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Initialize a QuantumUnit instance
qu = QuantumUnit()

# Create a quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Assert that the circuit produces an entangled state
initial_state = [0, 0]  # Initial state as a list of qubit states
entangled_state = [1 / np.sqrt(2), 0, 0, 1 / np.sqrt(2)]  # The expected entangled state
assert qu.assertEntangled(qc, initial_state, entangled_state)

```
